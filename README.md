FFXIV Crafting
==============

This repository is in-development. It is meant to be a reinforcement learning-based solver for crafting in Final Fantasy XIV. Currently it only consists of a simulator (./ffxiv-crafting), and a bare-bones trait implementation of a derivative of reinforcement learning I call "structured rewards" which extends the concept of numerical rewards to arbitrarily ordered structural types. After verification that the simulator is working, it should be fairly easy to merge these two into a proof-of-concept. Another potential avenue is evolutionary algorithms, it will take some testing to decide which works best.

NOTE: If you're viewing this project and it looks inactive, my current push to simulator completion is on other branches, which makes this project appear unupdated. View the pull requests or the drop down and look at those to see current progress!

Contribution welcome, but this project's license currently prohibits forking until it's in a ready state (FFXIV Teamcraft's simulator is likely what you want to use at the moment if you need one of those).
