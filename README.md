FFXIV Crafting
==============

This repository is in-development. It is meant to be a reinforcement learning-based solver for crafting in Final Fantasy XIV. Currently it only consists of a simulator (./ffxiv-crafting), and a bare-bones trait implementation of a derivative of reinforcement learning I call "structured rewards" which extends the concept of numerical rewards to arbitrarily ordered structural types. After verification that the simulator is working, it should be fairly easy to merge these two into a proof-of-concept.

Contribution welcome, but this project's license currently prohibits forking until it's in a ready state (FFXIV Teamcraft's simulator is likely what you want to use at the moment if you need one of those).
